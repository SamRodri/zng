# Release Process

This document covers how to bump versions and release the prebuilt binaries and crates. Release is partially automated, some manual steps must be followed and the automation must be monitored.

To make a release a `zng-ui` project owner needs to follow/monitor these steps:

0. Select a master commit to be the next release head.
   * All significant changes are documented in the CHANGELOG.
   * Auto README sections are updated, call `do doc --readme` and `do doc --readme-examples` to be sure.
   * All CI tests pass.
   * All examples look ok, call `do run --all` and manually test each.

1. Merge changes into `release` on GitHub.
    * This includes `Cargo.toml` version changes that must be reviewed manually.
    * You can use `do publish --diff` to get a list of crates and files that changed.
    * You can use `cargo semver-checks` to find breaking changes.
    * You can use `do publish --bump` to set the versions, update Cargo.toml doc examples and close the changelog.
    * Note that if setting manually the `zng-view-prebuilt` needs to have the same version as `zng`.

2. The release push triggers `.github/workflows/release-1-test-tag.yml`.
    * It will test in all platforms.
    * If all tests pass, it will create a new git tag `v{zng.version}`.

3. The git tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release-2-prebuild-publish.yml`.
    * It will generate new prebuilt binaries.
    * It will make a GitHub release for the new tag with the prebuilt binaries.

4. After you verify the GitHub release worked, manually cargo publish all changed crates.
    * This is fully manual.
    * You can use `do publish --check` to get a list of crates that need to be published.
    * And you can use `do publish --execute` to publish.
        - Note that this command will await the rate limit, 10 minutes per new crate and 1 minute per update.
          For updates there is a burst of 30.
    * Use `do publish --execute --no-burst` after a publish failure to continue.
        - The `--no-burst` flag zeroes the burst rate counter so it will wait the full delay (after the first publish).

## Webrender

Webrender is not published so we maintain our own fork in <https://github.com/zng-ui/zng-webrender>. These crates mostly untouched,
for now we just rename and remove a dependency that has a security advisory (`time`, does not impact Webrender, but shows in `cargo audit`).

To update these crates:

* Merge from upstream <https://github.com/servo/webrender>.
* Manually increment the minor version of each crate that changed.
* We depend on `zng-webrender`, `zng-swgl` and all local dependencies of these crates. As of last publish these are:

```
zng-peek-poke-derive
zng-peek-poke
zng-glsl-to-cxx
zng-wr-malloc-size-of
zng-webrender-build
zng-swgl
zng-webrender-api
zng-wr-glyph-rasterizer
zng-webrender
```

* Push changes to GitHub.
* Test the `zng` project, both `do test` and a manual review using `do prebuild` and `do run -all`.
* Manually publish each crate.

* If publishing new crates also set the crate owner `cargo owner --add github:zng-ui:owners [CRATE]`.
